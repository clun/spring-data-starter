## 1. Create an Apache Cassandra DB-as-a-service with DataStax Astra

`DataStax ASTRA` service is available at url [https://astra.datastax.com](https://astra.datastax.com/)

**‚úÖ Step 1a.Register (if needed) and Sign In to Astra** : You can use your `Github`, `Google` accounts or register with an `email`

- [Registration Page](https://astra.datastax.com/register)

![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/astra-create-register.png?raw=true)

- [Authentication Page](https://astra.datastax.com/)

![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/astra-create-login.png?raw=true)


**‚úÖ Step 1b. Fill the Create New Database Form** : As you don't have have any instances the login will route through the instance creation form. You will find below which values to enter for each field.

- *Initialization Form*
![TodoBackendClient](https://github.com/DataStax-Academy/microservices-java-workshop-online/blob/master/z-materials/images/astra-create-2.png?raw=true)

- **Set the Compute Size**: For the work we are doing please use `Free tier`. You instance will be there forever, free of charge. If you already have a free tier db that you created in a previous workshop (`killrvideo`) you can reuse it.

- **Select region**: This is the region where your database will reside physically (choose one close to you or your users). For people in EMEA please use `europe-west-1` idea here is to reduce latency.

- **Fill in the database name** - Proposed value `dev-workshop-db`. You can use any alphanumeric value it is not part of the connection fields. Now it will be part of a file downloaded later and you should avoid capital letters.

With the 3 fields below you can pick any name

- **Fill in the keyspace name** - Proposed value `todoapp` (no spaces, alpha numeric)

- **Fill in the user name** - `todouser`. Note the user name is case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Fill in the user password** - `todopassword`. Fill in both the password and the confirmation fields. Note that the password is also case-sensitive. Please use the case we suggest here.

- **Launch the database**. Review all the fields to make sure they are as shown, and click the Launch Database button.

**‚úÖ Step 2e.** Once you have copied your credentials, click to Open in Gitpod:

The credentials is a Json String that look like:
```json
{ 
  "clientId":"51926aea-0509-45c4-a2ee-4797574b92d6",
  "clientName":"your_email",
  "clientSecret":"your_secret"
}
```

## 3. Run the application in Gitpod

**‚úÖ Step 3a.** Click on the button below to open gitpod *(the cookie have to be enabled or you have to navigate to [here](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/DataStax-Examples/spring-data-starter))

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer)

**‚úÖ Step 3b.** Once your gitpod workspace has loaded paste your service account credentials and enter in the bottom of the screen

**‚úÖ Step 3c.**  After entering, open this link in your browser: http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/

The application is now started.

## 4. Use the Application 

**TodoMVC** is a fabulous community contribution that helps developers compare frameworks on the basis of actual project code, not just claims and anecdotes. TodoMVC is an immensely valuable attempt at a difficult problem - providing a structured way of comparing JS libraries and frameworks.

**‚úÖ Step 4a. Test TodoBackEnd Spec Runner** : Locate the [spec runner](https://www.todobackend.com/specs/index.html) and use the `endpoints` of your application it should look like `https://8081-b8553e52-d31f-4b6a-9d46-7db0074e29a5.ws-eu01.gitpod.io/todos` where you substitute your own gitpod instance id and region.

**‚úÖ Step 4b. Test TodoBackEnd Web Client** : todoBackend.com provides a [client](https://www.todobackend.com/client/index.html) to work with the API. As before pick one of the `endpoints` listed before and try the client.
